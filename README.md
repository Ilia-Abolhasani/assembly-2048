# 2048 Game - Assembly 8086 Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of the popular 2048 game using Assembly language (8086 architecture).

## Project Description

The project aims to recreate the 2048 game using Assembly language. The game involves merging tiles with the same number to form larger numbers, with the ultimate goal of reaching the 2048 tile. The implementation utilizes Assembly 8086 language to handle the game logic and user interactions.

## Files

- **2048 Source code.asm**: Assembly source code file containing the implementation of the game.
- **README.md**: This file providing information about the project.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have an Assembly 8086 compatible environment set up.
2. Assemble the code using an assembler like TASM or NASM.
3. Run the compiled executable to start the game.

## Controls

- Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move the tiles in the respective directions.
## Contribution

Contributions to this project are welcome. Feel free to submit bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests to improve the game.
